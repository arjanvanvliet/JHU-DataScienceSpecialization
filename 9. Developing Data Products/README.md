# Developing Data Products

This folder contains the course projects for the 9th module of Johns Hopkins University's Data Science Specialisation on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products)

## Module Description
A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.

## Deliverables
For this module course projects had to be created for week 2, week 3 and week 4.

### Week 2 course project
The assignment was to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

A map of The Hague with three locations related to the government or the Royal Family with custom marker icons and a message box with a link containing more information about the site was created. The result can be viewed using [GitHub pages](https://arjanvanvliet.github.io/JHU-DataScienceSpecialization/9.%20Developing%20Data%20Products/week2/Developing_Data_Products_-_Week_2_Exercise.html).

### Week 3 course project
The assignment was to create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly.

For this assignment the 'Orange' dataset (that comes with R) was used to plot tree circumference for the different trees over time.

The resulting presentation with plotly plot can be viewed using [GitHub Pages](https://arjanvanvliet.github.io/JHU-DataScienceSpecialization/9.%20Developing%20Data%20Products/week3/Developing_Data_Products_-_Week_3_Exercise.html).

### Week 4 course project
This week's assignment had two parts. First, to create a Shiny application and deploy it on RStudio's servers. Second, use Slidify or RStudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

For this assignment the 'ChickWeight' dataset (that come with R) was used to create a simple Shiny app that plots chicken weight over time for the individual chickens or as a diet average. Furthermore, using the input slider the timeframe of the plot could be adjusted.

The resulting Shiny app is posted on R's free shinyapp.io webpage and can be viewed here: [Chicken Weight Shiny App](https://arjanvanvliet.shinyapps.io/DevelopingDataProductsWeek4/).

The pitch presentation was created using Slidify and hosted on GitHub pages were it can also be viewed: [Slidify Pitch Presentation](https://arjanvanvliet.github.io/JHU-DataScienceSpecialization/9.%20Developing%20Data%20Products/week4/).
