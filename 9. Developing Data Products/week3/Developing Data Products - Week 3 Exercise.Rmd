```{r Orange, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

Orange$Tree <- factor(Orange$Tree, levels = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1))
plot_ly(Orange, x=~age, y=~circumference,
        type = "scatter", mode = "lines",
        color = ~factor(Tree),
        hoverinfo = 'text',
        text = ~paste("Age: ", age, ' days<br>Circumference:', circumference, ' mm'))
```
